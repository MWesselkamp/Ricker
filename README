Structure:

modelclass.py - contains the forecast model to simulate from. Uncertainties considerable in the simulation:
                Process (sigma) and observation error. Parameter uncertainties (sd)
baseline.py - the evaluation baseline for the experiment, i.e. the 'true' or 'potential' EFH. Prediction of the model EFH with
               various approaches in a perfect model setting, using simulated observations as reference.
profiency_metrics.py - contains a range of proficiency metrics to select for EFH computation.
dynamics.py - functions related to the model and system dynamics.
main.py - currently a spin-off from baseline.py REWORK, not useable.

#=========================#
# Simulate reference data #
#=========================#

Here we specify the growth rate (r) and intial conditions (N0) of the 'true' time series.
We also define their 'true' uncertainties.
With this, we simulate a set of time series, i.e. a set of observed populations.
We plot these time series and then split it into a training and test set.

Important decisions:
- What does the reference data look like? Where do we have it from?
