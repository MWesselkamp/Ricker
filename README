Determining the forecasting horizon of the Ricker model with selected approaches.

Uncertainties considered in the forecasting system:
- process/observation error (not distinguished!) (sigma)
- parameter uncertainties (sd)

#=========================#
# Simulate reference data #
#=========================#

Here we specify the growth rate (r) and intial conditions (N0) of the 'true' time series.
We also define their 'true' uncertainties.
With this, we simulate a set of time series, i.e. a set of observed populations.
We plot these time series and then split it into a training and test set.

Important decisions:
- What does the reference data look like? Where do we have it from?

#==============================#
# Fit the model to 'real' data #
#==============================#

Here, we want to infer the growth rate of a set of time series, that we assume descend from the same population
from the data.
We therefore make prior assumptions about the process/observation error (sigma).
We also define a prior for the growth rate (mean) and its uncertainty (sd).
We receive posterior distributions for parameters and process error, as well as a posterior
predictive distribution for y.

Important decisions:
- Assumptions about the priors.
- Constant or dynamic growth rate r.
- Sampling algorithm.

#=====================================#
# Forecast with the fit model to test #
#=====================================#

We use these posterior distributions to forecast to the test data.

Important decisions:
- Metric to evaluate forecast.
